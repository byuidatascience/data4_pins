# M221 Data Script Details

This folder has all scripts that were originally used in BYU-I's m221.

1. Elena put in `intro_stats/torun` and then hathaway move out to `intro_stats`. Elena puts the path to the file in the `qmd` not using the `torun` subfolder.
2. Once Hathaway puts the files in `intro_stats` then they have been executed to posit.byui.edu pins.
3. Elena can move the `.qmd` to the `website/posts/intro_stats` folder
