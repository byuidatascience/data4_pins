# BYU-I Course Project Data 

We use two primary sources to manage and share course project data. 1) pins at posit.byui.edu and 2) the data blog at XXXX.  Each blog post represents a description of a data set. This repository contains the derivation scripts that generate the data.

## File size

> An important factor in determining whether or not to use a pin is the size of the data or object in use. As a general rule of thumb, __we donâ€™t recommend using pins with files over 500 MB__. If you find yourself routinely pinning data larger than this, then you might need to reconsider your data engineering pipeline.
