<span class="listing-description">The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute gives the following explanation of COPD: COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. “Progressive” means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus (a slimy substance), wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust, also may contribute to COPD. A study was conducted in the United Kingdom to determine if there is a difference in the effectiveness of community-based rehabilitation program compared to hospital-based rehabilitation. Because hospital-based rehabilitation tends to be more expensive, the researchers wanted to assess if there is a significant difference in the patients’ improvement under the two programs. If not, then it makes sense to refer patients to the less expensive treatment option. Patients suffering from COPD were randomly assigned to either the community or hospital group. Twice a week for six weeks, they participated in two-hour educational and exercise sessions. Patients were also encouraged to exercise between sessions. The effectiveness of the program was measured based on the total distance patients could walk at one time at a particular pace. This is called the endurance shuttle walking test (ESWT). This was measured at the beginning of the study and again at the end of the six-week rehabilitation period. Negative values indicate that the distance decreased. </span>

The target was placed 115 cm above the ground and at a distance of 10 m from the players. Using electronic equipment, the researchers recorded the distance from the center of the target to the point where the ball hit. The subjects wore five different soccer shoes, and for one treatment they kicked the ball in stocking feet.

Experts may disagree on their interpretations, and in order for the dimensions of the vertebrae to be used, they need a standard against which they can be compared. A group of researchers wanted to try a new approach to define what this standard of normal vertebral dimensions could be. Using lateral spinal radiographs, the heights of the vertebrae of 2992 women between the ages of 65 and 70 were recorded. Anterior, middle, and posterior measurements were taken. The data in the file represent the middle measurements. All the vertebrae were measured, but only the data on the T4 vertebra are represented. Note: Due to SPSS student version limitations, a random sample of 1000 values (rather than 2992) was selected). </span>

<span class="listing-description">On rare occasions, a medical procedure is performed on the wrong body part of the body or on the wrong patient. These are called wrong-site and wrong-patient mistakes. Such errors occur hundreds of times each year across the country. It is not always required to report these mistakes, so not every instance is counted. In a small percentage of these cases, the patient files a lawsuit against the hospital. The medical community is trying to eliminate these errors but have had difficulty reducing their frequency. Philip Stahel et al.&nbsp;conducted a study on these mistakes and the lawsuits that follow. Costs to hospitals resulting from wrong-site and wrong-patient lawsuits were collected. </span>

<span class="listing-description">The protein requirement of an individual is the amount of protein they must consume daily to stay in equilibrium. This number varies from individual to individual. Nutritionists often give the protein requirement in terms of grams of good quality protein per kilogram of body weight per day (g P * kg-1 * d-1). It is very difficult and expensive to measure the protein requirement in humans, but research into this area is very important. For example, how much protein should you give to a patient in a health care facility who must be fed enterally (i.e., through a feeding tube)? There are several ways in which nutritionists have tried to measure the protein requirement. Traditionally, they have used a method called Nitrogen Balance. In a nitrogen balance experiment, researchers provide a carefully controlled diet containing prescribed amounts of protein to each subject for an extended period of time. They then collect data on the amount of protein utilized by the body. This includes collecting and analyzing samples of urine, feces, blood, sweat, tears, exfoliated skin, etc. Most researchers collect urine and fecal samples and estimate other losses. The protein requirement is estimated as the level of intake required so that the amount of protein consumed is exactly equal to the losses. Because of the difficulty of measuring protein losses, and since protein is essentially the only source for dietary nitrogen, nitrogen is used as a marker for protein. A nitrogen balance experiment was conducted to determine if there is a difference in the mean protein requirement of individuals in four groups: 1. Old men (age 63-81) 2. Old women (age 63-81) 3. Young men (age 21-46) 4. Young women (age 21-46) Subjects were provided with a controlled diet for three months and were required to comply with study protocol. The data set gives the measured protein requirements for each of the subjects. </span>

<span class="listing-description">Obesity is a growing problem worldwide. Many scientists are seeking creative solutions to trim down this epidemic. Reduced energy expenditure is a potential cause of obesity. Resting energy expenditure (REE) is defined as the amount of energy a person would use if resting for 24 hours. In essence, this is the amount of energy that a person’s body will consume if they do not do any physical activity. REE is measured in terms of kilojoules per day (kJ/d). REE accounts for approximately 70 to 80% of all energy that a person will expend in a day. If researchers can find simple, enjoyable activities that will increase REE, it may be possible to minimize the spread of obesity around the world. Ebba Carlsson and other researchers in Sweden investigated the effect of listening to stressful classical music on a person’s REE. The REE was measured by indirect calorimetry using the Deltatrac II Metabolic Monitor. Each subject’s REE was measured during silence and again while listening to stressful classical music. The “stressful” classical music included: Béla Bartók’s String Quartet No.&nbsp;4 : Prestissimo, con sordino Igor Stravinsky’s “Infernal Dance of all Kashchei’s Subjects” from The Firebird Hans Werner Henze’s “Dies Irae,” second movement from Requiem: Nine Sacred Concertos for Piano, Trumpet Concertante and Chamber Orchestra Dataset consists of simulated data matching reported summary statistics. </span>

<span class="listing-description">Head and Body length of estuarine crocodiles These data were collected in order to estimate the length of the Sarcosuchus imperator, nicknamed “SuperCroc.” Sarcosuchus is a large creature that lived about 112 million years ago. It seems to resemble modern crocodiles, even though it is currently believed that Sarcosuchus is not an ancestor of extant crocodiles. A complete skeleton of Sarcosuchus has not yet been discovered, but a remarkably complete skull and other bones from a large specimen of this species were found in Niger, Africa. These fossils are in the collections of the Musée National du Niger (MNN). This is the largest verified Sarcosuchus skull. Unfortunately, many of the tail bones have not been recovered, making a positive determination of the length of Sarcosuchus impossible. Because the skull length of Sarchosuchus is known, the researchers wanted to use the head-to-body length ratios of modern crocodiles to estimate the body length of Sarcosuchus. The skull shape is similar to Gavialis gangeticus and Crocodylus porosus, so those species were used for estimation.

The researchers randomly assigned 192 undergraduate participants into three experimental groups. Each student was asked to complete a weekly journal in which they recorded five specific things and then answered some questions about their feelings about life in general. The groups were as follows: Group 1 (Gratitude): The participants in this group were asked to record five things each week for which they were grateful or thankful. Group 2 (Hassles): The volunteers in this group recorded five irritants that had occurred to them in the previous week. Group 3 (Events—Control group): The people in the events group recorded five things that occurred in the past week that had an impact on them.</span>

<span class="listing-description">A comet is a small icy object which orbits the sun. As a comet approaches the sun, water and other particles thaw and detach from the comet. This forms a small temporary atmosphere called a coma, and in some cases, a tail. WaterProduction is a measure of the amount of water that the comet is releasing. It is measured in terms of Log[Q(H2O)]. Higher values indicate that more water is being released. The “Magnitude” of a comet is a measure of how bright it is appears to be. The magnitude depends on several factors, including the distance to the comet. The magnitude reported here is the negative of the “heliocentric” magnitude, or the magnitude of the comet as viewed from the location of the Sun. Magnitude is measured as the negative logarithm of brightness. The AdjustedMagnitude is the negative of the magnitude, so brighter comets have higher positive values. Important Note: Magnitude is measured on a negative logarithmic scale! This means that comets that are very bright have a low value for their magnitude. Faint comets have a high magnitude value. The magnitude data have been adjusted by recording the negative of the magnitude. </span>

<span class="listing-description">For several years, researchers have used statistics to try to determine the author of a disputed literary work. These techniques have been applied to the Federalist Papers, disputed Shakespearean plays, and other works including the Book of Mormon. These methods are commonly called wordprinting or stylometry. One technique used in wordprint analysis is to count the frequency with which an author uses non-contextual words. These are words that do not convey meaning but connect the ideas into sentences. It is postulated that an author who is trying to forge a work would not be able to control their subconscious use of these words. So, if Joseph Smith wrote the Book of Mormon, we should expect to see his “wordprint” throughout the text, and the frequency of use of non-contextual words is one way to observe this. The most common non-contextual words used in The Book of Mormon are “and,” “of,” “that,” “the,” “to,” and “unto.” Blocks of text were taken from 2 Nephi 4 (Nephi, son of Lehi), Enos 1 (Enos, son of Jacob), 3 Nephi 15 (Jesus Christ), Moroni 9 (Mormon, son of Mormon), and Moroni 10 (Moroni, son of Mormon)</span>

<span class="listing-description">Estimating percentage of body fat is one method by which the health of a person is assessed. To measure it accurately is often inconvenient or costly (finding density involves underwater weighing), so methods of estimation have been derived using more conveniently obtained measurements. The densities of 252 men were measured, and from that, their percent body fat was determined. Many other body measurements were also taken for comparison and estimation. </span>

The batting average is computed by dividing the number of successful hits by the number of times the player has been at bat. A “time at bat” is every time the player leaves the home base after receiving pitches, but some exceptions apply. The batting averages of 446 baseball players were downloaded from Sean Lahman’s Baseball Archive at baseball1.com.</span>

<span class="listing-description">Computer software is commonly used to translate text from one language to another. As part of his Ph.D.&nbsp;thesis, Philipp Koehn developed a phrase-based translation program called Pharaoh. A good translation system should match a professional human translation. It is important to be able to quantify how good the translations produced by Pharaoh are. The IBM T. J. Watson Research Center developed methods to measure the quality of a translation. One of these is the BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU). BLEU scores indicate how well a computer translation matches a professional human translation of the same text. BLEU helps companies who develop translation software “to monitor the effect of daily changes to their systems in order to weed out bad ideas from good ideas.” BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores corresponding to better translations. To test Pharaoh’s ability to translate, Koehn took 100 blocks of Spanish text, each of which contained 300 sentences, and used Pharaoh to translate each to English. The BLEU score was calculated for each of the 100 blocks.</span>
